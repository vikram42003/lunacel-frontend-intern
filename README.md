# Lunacel Frontend Intern Assignment Project

This project was created with <b>Typescript, Nextjs and Tailwind.</b>

It is hosted on Vercel. The link is in the github repo (should be to the top right of the page at https://github.com/vikram42003/lunacel-frontend-intern)

## Features
- Followed the Figma design as closely as possible
- All components were designed to be reusable and stylable with Tailwind (wherever appropriate)
- The UI is set to be responsive for all screen sizes above 768px (as instructed)
- All colors, fonts and icons were picked up from the figma design
- The design of interactive elements (buttons, carousel) was also designed to replicate the figma design as closely as possible
- Used Framer Motion for the button animations in the ProfileWidget
- Used Splide.js for carousel animations in GalleryWidget
